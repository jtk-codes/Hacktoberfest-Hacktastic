## Welcome to Hacktoberfest 

#### Want to get started with a fun PR? 
- Drop in a snippet of code you FIGURED OUT this week, in `snippets/working` or drop a snippet of code you are STUCK on this week in `snippets/nonworking`

- Please make your examples reproducible - ie, something someone could run in a REPL
- This is all fun and to help each other out, so be sure your snippet has some good comments!
